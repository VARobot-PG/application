# SPEARED
- To build this repository basically follow these instructions: https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/install-the-tools. 
For sure you need Unity (2019.3). The unity project is contained in spearedar.  
- To install the server follow the instructions in speareddocker.  
- To install the webeditor follow open the index.html in spearedweb (probably you need to change the address of the ros backend server in the code).

For more instructions, consider the theses of Jonas Eilers & Michael Wieneke
